This repository is a reflection of curiosity, imagination, and the drive to keep learning and building.

##  About the Project
**The Creative Loop** is where I explore and document my creative journey through:
- **Design concepts** — UI/UX layouts, graphic ideas, and visual storytelling  
- **Code experiments** — small projects, interactive scripts, and web prototypes  
- **Innovation & learning** — blending creativity with technology

Each project here represents a loop of inspiration, creation, and growth.

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
